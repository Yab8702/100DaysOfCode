This project showcases a classic shooting game where you control a shooter to eliminate invading aliens. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

### 1. Shooting Mechanism

Use the arrow keys to control the shooter and the "Arrow Up" key to shoot lasers at the invading aliens. Aim carefully to hit the aliens and earn points.

### 2. Dynamic Alien Movement

The game features dynamic alien movement, making it challenging for players. The aliens move back and forth, requiring strategic maneuvers to eliminate them.

### 3. Difficulty Levels

To enhance the gaming experience, three difficulty levels are introduced - easy, medium, and hard. Each difficulty level adjusts the speed and behavior of the invading aliens.

### 4. Celebration on Victory

Experience a celebratory animation and a change in the background color when you successfully eliminate all the invading aliens. Enjoy the victory moment!

### 5. User-Friendly Difficulty Buttons

Interactive difficulty buttons allow you to choose your preferred level of challenge. Once a difficulty level is selected, the corresponding button is highlighted, and the other buttons are disabled to prevent multiple selections.

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to move the shooter.
3. Press the "Arrow Up" key to shoot lasers.
